# PRISM - Provider Resource Issue Scanning & Monitoring

**PRISM** is an intelligent multi-agent system built with Strands SDK that automatically analyzes and tests AWSCC (AWS Cloud Control) provider issues from the Terraform provider repository. It helps maintainers quickly understand, reproduce, and validate configuration problems using the latest provider versions.

## What PRISM Does

**Issue Discovery**: Automatically fetches issues labeled `needs-triage` from the terraform-provider-awscc repository

**Latest Provider Testing**: Always uses the latest AWSCC provider version for accurate testing

**Configuration Testing**: Extracts Terraform configurations from issue descriptions and tests them in isolated environments

**Automated Analysis**: Runs complete Terraform lifecycle (`init`, `validate`, `plan`, `apply`, `destroy`) to reproduce reported problems

**Smart Cleanup**: Automatically removes large Terraform files (.terraform/, state files) to save disk space

**Documentation**: Generates comprehensive markdown reports with test results, error analysis, and reproduction steps

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Uses specialized MCP-enabled agents for different aspects of issue analysis
- **Latest Provider Versions**: Automatically queries and uses the latest AWSCC provider version
- **GitHub Integration**: Uses GitHub MCP server to fetch and analyze issues
- **Terraform Automation**: Full Terraform lifecycle testing with proper error handling and cleanup
- **AWS Documentation**: Integrates AWS documentation MCP server for expert analysis
- **Automated Execution**: Runs without manual confirmation prompts for streamlined operation
- **Intelligent Filtering**: Excludes resource-suppression issues and focuses on recent problems
- **Clean Environment**: Automatically cleans up large files and AWS resources after testing

## Quick Start

1. **Setup Environment**:
   ```bash
   ./run_triage.sh
   ```

2. **Configure Settings** (optional):
   Edit `agent_config.json` to customize:
   - Maximum age of issues to analyze
   - Number of issues to process
   - Model configuration

3. **Run Analysis**:
   The system will automatically:
   - Fetch qualifying issues using GitHub MCP
   - Get latest AWSCC provider version using Terraform MCP
   - Extract and test configurations
   - Clean up large files and AWS resources
   - Generate comprehensive analysis reports

## Configuration

The agent behavior is controlled by `agent_config.json`:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "name": "PRISM",
    "description": "Provider Resource Issue Scanning & Monitoring"
  },
  "github": {
    "repo": "hashicorp/terraform-provider-awscc",
    "labels": {
      "include": ["needs-triage"],
      "exclude": ["resource-suppression"]
    },
    "max_age_days": 10,
    "max_issues": 1
  },
  "model": {
    "model_id": "us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0",
    "temperature": 0.3,
    "max_tokens": 4096
  }
}
```

## Output

PRISM generates:
- **Individual test directories**: `issue_<id>/` for each analyzed issue
- **Triage reports**: `triage_issue_<id>.md` with detailed analysis
- **Clean workspace**: Large Terraform files automatically removed after testing

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- Terraform CLI
- AWS CLI configured
- GitHub access (for MCP server)
- Strands SDK with strands-agents-tools
- Docker/Finch (for Terraform MCP server)

## Architecture

PRISM uses a multi-agent MCP-enabled approach:
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Coordinates the overall workflow and delegates tasks
- **GitHub Agent**: Uses GitHub MCP server to fetch and analyze issues
- **Terraform Agent**: Uses Terraform MCP server and shell tools for testing with latest provider versions
- **Analysis Agent**: Uses AWS Documentation MCP server for expert analysis and report generation

Built with the Strands SDK for robust agent orchestration, MCP servers for external integrations, and AWS Bedrock for intelligent analysis.

## TODO

- **S3 Archival**: Copy analyzed configurations and results to S3 bucket for long-term storage and historical analysis
- **Issue Tracking**: Implement database/file system to track previously analyzed issues and avoid duplicate processing when GitHub API returns same issues
